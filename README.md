This is a web application that monitors the auction house for things that you have listed.

also has an index of all items and view any item with a bunch of different criteria.

want to be able to guess the time it takes to sell by monitoring the item and keeping track of it based on history. to do this will need to remember the qty of the lists and try to guess the order size and the time that they all sell.
